## Patient Mortality Prediction Using LSTM

![Hospital](./chlalogo.jpg)

This repository presents a deep learning project for predicting patient mortality using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project aims to predict mortality based on medical encounter data from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and visualization steps are outlined below.
